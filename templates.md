# 3. Complete Word

We have stack images.
([www.pschool.in/author/images](https://pschool.in/author/images)). Allow
students to write one or more missing letters. We can have an input component
(like shown in image) or a set of options to pick from.

Instead of image, we can also give a clue as text. (something like a crossword
clue)

It is just a variation of the above activity. Giving options may be easy to
guess. The input component may be hard for a kid to type. In such case, the kid
has to connect letters from left to write as shown in the image.
